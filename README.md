## Further Resources 

1. **FULL CODE:** Full HTML and CSS code here on my GitHub repository (https://github.com/craftykate/bhs-sample-project-site). I encourage you to modify your code! Feel safe knowing if you totally mess up and need to start over you can come back here to get the full code of what we did in class - you'll just need to put your own details back in. 
1. **CODE VALIDATING:** <br/>
Visit https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input to validate your HTML <br/>
Visit http://www.css-validator.org/#validate_by_input to validate your CSS <br/>
This is ALWAYS a good idea before sending your code out into the wild
1. **REFERENCE:** Looking to learn more about a particular HTML or CSS feature? Start with W3Schools.com for <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">HTML</a> or <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp">CSS</a>
1. **CHEAT SHEET:** A great HTML CheatSheet! https://htmlcheatsheet.com
1. **GIT:** If you are going to be doing more programming I highly recommend doing a <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git">quick tutorial on git</a>. Save your program as you go with git and easily roll back to previous saves if something goes horribly wrong. Which it will.
1. **CHROME:** Chrome is an excellent developer browser! View > Developer > Developer Tools will show the html of any website. I highly recommend becoming familiar with Chrome's developer tools if you are going to build sites
1. **STACK OVERFLOW:** Stuck on a problem you can't solve? Trying to do something beyond your capabilities? <a href="https://stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a> is an excellent resource of questions and answers from the community.
1. **CAN I USE:** Not all browsers support all CSS features the same way. Search on <a href="https://caniuse.com/#home">CanIUse.com</a> for a particular feature to see which browsers support it, what percentage of users are covered and which features you need to write with prefixes for better support.
1. **FURTHER TUTORIALS:** Try codecademy for free tutorials on <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html">HTML</a> and <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-css">CSS</a> to expand your knowledge
1. **LADIES!** Did you know <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2014/10/06/345799830/the-forgotten-female-programmers-who-created-modern-tech">women were the first programmers</a>?? In a recent study of over 3 MILLION pull requests on github (peer-reviewed code) the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/12/women-considered-better-coders-hide-gender-github">code written by women</a> was approved at a higher rate than code written by men. Women make excellent programmers and the tech world needs you! Check out <a href="https://girlswhocode.com/">girlswhocode</a> for more resources just for you!

## Follow up for Sep 2018 class:

1. **href = “hypertext reference”** Incredibly interesting article on what href stands for (seems like lots of people have wondered this) here: https://tomayko.com/blog/2008/wtf-is-an-href-anyway
1. To add hover text to an image: <img src=“image.jpg” alt=“sample image” **title=“hi, I should pop up!”** />
1. **AngularJS vs ReactJS vs NodeJS**: there are some great articles! Like https://www.markupbox.com/blog/angularjs-vs-reactjs-vs-nodejs-which-one-is-best/ Make sure you feel confident in your JavaScript skills first. 
1. Font sizing: em vs px vs pt: https://kyleschaeffer.com/development/css-font-size-em-vs-px-vs-pt-vs/
